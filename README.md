**Creating AI frameworks for assessing and predicting post-flood recovery**
This project predicts flood occurrence based on various environmental factors and assesses post-flood recovery. The project uses a Random Forest Classifier for flood prediction and provides recovery assessments based on factors like recovery funds, infrastructure damage, and population affected.
